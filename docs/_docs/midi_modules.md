## Summary

Currently there are not many midi modules supported.

To onboard a new one, plug it in and then in your syntheffect workspace run

```
$ bin/onboard-midi.py midi/TYPE_NAME.midi.yml
```

substituting TYPE_NMAE for a name like `icon_icontrols` (making the argument `midi/icon_icontrols.midi.yml`)
