# SynthEffect

SynthEffect is my personal VJing software. It is a stack of OpenFrameworks and GLSL shaders meant to be controlled by a Cmd Micro midi controller. I use it to do live effects on heavy metal music videos.

This software is currently for my personal use. If you'd like to try to get it going for yourself, file a ticket and I'll help.

## Goals

In order to be considered "gig ready"

* Collection of effects sufficient enough to gig with
* Midi control capable enough to provide a compelling tailored experience
* Can maximize on an external display, freeing up local display
* Reads from a playlist of files
* Can mix in my personal tag/watermark
* Stable!
